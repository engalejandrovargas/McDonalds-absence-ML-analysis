# From Chemical Engineering to Data-Driven Insights at McDonald's

## Introduction

Hello! I am Alejandro, a chemical engineer turned data enthusiast. With a background in chemical engineering and specialized training in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am on a mission to derive actionable insights from data in unconventional settings. This project is a testament to that endeavor, focusing on data analysis of McDonald's LINE Group Chat.

## Background

### A Passion for Data Science
After earning my degree in chemical engineering, I found myself increasingly drawn towards the data-centric nature of decision-making in business and technology. This led me to invest in mastering Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, fueling my transition into the realm of data science.

### An Adventure in Japan
I decided to broaden my horizons by moving to Japan, a country known for its technological advancements and unique work culture. Here, I have been able to meld my analytical skills with real-world data while working at McDonald's, a global fast-food chain.

### Finding Insights in Everyday Operations
While the fast-food industry might seem far removed from data science, I've found that even a McDonald's outlet is a treasure trove of data. This project leverages that data to provide insights into employee behavior, customer interactions, and operational efficiencies.

## Project Overview

### Data Source
The data source for this project is the LINE Group Chat used by employees at my McDonald's outlet, a rich dataset that reveals numerous aspects of day-to-day operations.

### Objective
The project aims to:

- Analyze patterns in employee absences to optimize staffing
- Use text mining techniques to identify common phrases and topics discussed
- Perform sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of communications

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

## Conclusion

This project is more than just an academic exercise; it's a reflection of my continuous journey in leveraging data for actionable insights, regardless of the industry or setting. From the chemical plants to fast-food chains, the power of data is ubiquitous, waiting to be tapped into.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. Your feedback and questions are always welcome.
